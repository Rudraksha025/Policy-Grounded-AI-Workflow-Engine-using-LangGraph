Loan Rejection Policy:

A loan must be rejected if:
- The applicant has no verified income proof.
- Credit score is below 600.
- Employment history is less than 6 months.
- There are more than two prior defaults.
- Do not approve loans for applicants whose income is from gambling.
- Never approve loans if the applicant has defaulted in the last 6 months.


The explanation must be professional, factual, and avoid uncertainty.
Never use phrases such as "I think", "maybe", or "not sure".
